# Directed acyclic graph(DAG) Network, FeedForward loops
This code is a function that gets an undirected graph and transforms it to a DAG network (Directed acyclic network)
It gets an adjacency matrix as input and returns new adjacency matrix. This new network has only one leader node that has zero in_degrees
new graph is connected based on directed networks defenition.
